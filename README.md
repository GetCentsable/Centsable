# Centsable

## Small Change, Big Impact!

## What is it?

*Centsable was started as a Capstone project by five Full Stack students from Atlas School Tulsa. Our idea is to create an app that people can use to make small donations to causes of their choice regularly, by automatically rounding up purchases and donating the change to pre-selected content creators and organizations. We believe this project has the potential for real-world development and intend to seek backers to help us see through its potential.*
