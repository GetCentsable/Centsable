# Centsable

## Description

Hey there! Thanks for checking out our project.

Centsable was started as a Capstone project by five Full Stack students from Atlas School Tulsa. In four short weeks, we went through the process of brainstorming, identifying a viable idea, narrowing scope, programming execution, and ended with a great base for a potential startup application. 

Centsable is an app that can be used to make small donations to multiple causes regularly, by automatically rounding up purchases and donating the change to pre-selected content creators or various other organizations. We believe this project has the potential for real-world development and intend to seek backers to help us see through its potential.

## The Team
This project was a testament to the power of teamwork. We faced some challenges, primarily with learning AWS in a short amount of time in order to use it for hosting our page. We pivoted to Firebase and it was smooth sailing from there! 

Tayler Coon - Tayler brought the frontend to life with his enthusiasm for carousels and seamless navigation.

Rob Farley - Rob led the backend team to success with his levelheaded decision-making, strong communication, and experience with hosting services.

Ben Harper - Ben did a little bit of everything, from assisting with project management software to designing the database architecture for the backend.

Sloane Markland - Sloane headed up project management, from helping the team define the scope and keep the big picture in perspective, to marketing and presentation design.

Shadi Shwiyat - Shadi took on the major responsibility of security and integrating the front and backend.
